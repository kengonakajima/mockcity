Moai SDK
====
Moai binary is put in bin directory.

These binaries are built on my machine.

If you want your own binary, you'd use [Moai SDK](https://github.com/moai/moai-dev)
or my [OSX modification](https://github.com/kengonakajima/moai-dev) .

Make sure that you use three-dee branch to have 3D functionalities.

Now Moai SDK 1.0 will have 3D in official default releases, but not yet.(2012/02)
